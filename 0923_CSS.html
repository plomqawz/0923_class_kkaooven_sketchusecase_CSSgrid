    <div>NAVIGATION</div>
    <div>Navigation[1] is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.[2] The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.[1]

        It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns.
        
        Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction.[1] In this sense, navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation.[1]</div>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology
of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility
and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
and repetition in the structural content
